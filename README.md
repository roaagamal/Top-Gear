# Top Gear


## Overview

This is a presentation about an app that helps the users to predict the miles per gallon of their car based on the specifications of the car.

The variables that we are using for the prediction are the following:

1. Horsepower
2. Number of cylinders
3. Transmission type 
4. Weight of the car.


## Functionality

The user need to insert the horsepower, number of cylinders, transmission type, weight of the car in 1000 lbs. Then the application is going to filter the data and is going to build a model of the mpg rate of the car based on specifications and the users will get the rate in the main page of their device.
